## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Thanh Hai (aka Luke)

I like coding, I do stuff related to **Web development**, I work mainly with **React/Node** and **Pure Javascript**.

## Brief timeline of my career

#### April 2021 - now
- Frontend Developer at Dwarves Foundation


See more about my working experiences on [my resume](/resume) page.

## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

More than just technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a Software Engineer.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment or hear your thoughts on what I wrote <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
