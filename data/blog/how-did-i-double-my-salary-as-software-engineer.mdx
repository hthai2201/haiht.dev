![How Did I Double My Salary as Software Engineer](/static/images/1/thumbnail.jpg)
- Have you ever felt like you're wasting time during useless meetings?
- Have you ever thought that you can manage your day and time better than your manager?
- Have you ever wanted to unleash your true potential?
It would be nice to devote all your working  time to important tasks. 
Those that bring the greatest benefit both to the company and to you

Is it possible? -- Yes!

### World's tendencies
Covid is screwing real-world economics. Meanwhle, online economics is growing like crazy. 
Companies move their businesses online. To do this, companies need developers -- 
the most valuable resource on the market.

**Qualified developers are in demand**. Their salaries are growing but their potential is often wasted.

Lots of <u>Companies struggle with management and efficiency</u>. 
One day there is a burnning deadline, the other day there is no work to do. 
Add here dozens of meetings. Happens that manegement is super inefficient.

These aren't <u>bad companies</u>. T
hey may have reasons to act so: a small product and <u>lack of work</u> for the entire development team, 
following  the trend and moving the business online without any real motivation, jus bad management, etc.

As a result, some developers have schedulers half empty.Projects are not very interesting. 
There is time that could be better spent.

### How to make better use of your time?
Some time ago I was in one of such companies. My schedule was half empty, 
I was bored with the project, and I had dozens of meeting every day. 
But the salary was good enough to stay there.

So I decided to find an interesting side gig. 
First, it was my pet project, but then  I decided to find another job. Yes, the second one. 
I had one already, but I wanted to have one more. **Why not? 2jobs -- 2 salaries**

I wasn't sure if this was possibl. In fact, everything turned out to be easier than expected.

### Requirements
#### Remote work
First of all, I needed to work remotely. There was no other choice. 
I couldn't visit 2 officers in different cities on the same day. 
Actually, I ddin't want to visit the office anymore at all.

The beginning of the Covid pandemic  helped. All companies changed their work requirements. 
Previously remote work was  an advantage for the employee. Because of Covid, it became an advantage for the employer

Remote work is the new norm of the modern world. 
If you would like ti try the same experiment there would be no problems with going remote

#### Seniority
The softwware developers have signidicant compensation progress with their title progress. 
Middle developers can make twice as much as Junior. Senior as Middle. Staff aas Senior.

There is no sense in a second job as a Junior Deveoper, He would burn out without any visible results. 
When you are Junior or Middle, it's the right time to learn and develop skills. 
Time to make more  money will come soon.

So make sure that your salary is worth doubling. 
It should be worth working 2 jobs. It isn't easy task to manage 2 jobs.

#### Personal traits
**You sould be focking awesome**. I suppose you are if you consider managing 2 jobs at the same time. 
Some mandatory personal traits to do it.

**You should be able to:**
- perform complex tasks in short terms 
- manage time efficiently
- have amazing communicaion skills
- sacrifice weekends to complete the tasks
- work efficiently under pressure
- have enough motivation to do all the above
- solve potential ethical conflict

All of the above is not easy. But you can handle it.
### Implementation plan:
#### 1. Less attendance, more value
The first thing you need to do is  talk to your manager. Explain the situation as honestly as possible. 
Assure hime that you will still perform all required actions. 
You will close all tasks and visit all important meetings.

Tell him that you start to feel burnout and need some more space and fresh air.
You need new projects and opportunities. Probably they may exist even inside yourn own company.

But you need more free time. You don't want to waste your time in useless discussions and meetings. 
It'a a reasonable request.

Mostly casses, your calendar will become cleaner.
#### 2. Get a job
This one should be easy for you. As mentioned above you are probably an awesome software engineer. 
So just search for a bjo on the market.

Remember what you did to get the current job and repeat the same actions - pass the interview and get an offer.

The crucial thing is to be super strict while choosing the 2nd job. 
It has to meet all requirements: flexible schedule, low attendance, few meetings, familiar technology stack, etc.
The less mandatory stuff, the better it is.

#### 3. Survive
When you get the second job the buggest fun begins. You need to survive 2 jobs at the same time. 
Obviously, it isn't an easy task. It will force you to do your best, work 150% every day.

From some point of view, it's coll. The harder it is, the better it is. 
Imagine how easy it would be for you to switch to 1 job sometime later. I did it after a year of this challenge. 
It was a pure blessing
### What about the ethical aspect?
this one may seem tricky, but actually, it isn't.

**Until you perform well in both of your jobs, there is no ethical conflict.**
The company pays you for you work. It has some standards and requirements. 
If you meet these requirements, you are a great employee and deserve your salary. So your real performance matters.

**As long as your jobs don't suffer, there is conflict at all.**
 Everybody wins. The developer gets more money. Each company receives the exact aamount of effort it need. 
 Everybody should be happy.

Saying it, I presume your two different companies don't conflict and intersect each other. 
Unless you want to have a dozen of sues.

### Final notes
Managing 2 jobs isn't an easy task. I was able to do it only for one year. It was an interesting experience, but I don't want to do it again.

 You may give it  a try. You will really get 2 salaries, so your incomes will double.
 BUt be aware of  potenial issuesL stress, more work to do, complex communications, 2 teams, and managers to live with, etc.

### Disclaimer:
> If  person can't perform well or please both employers at once, he should stop!
> The emploeyee gets money, not for nothing. He gets money for his work. If he can't complete it at the required level, he shouldn't get his compensation. It would be honest to fire home for underperformance.
